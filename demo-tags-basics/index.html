        <h1>Markup Demo</h1>
       <p>There are many ways to make a presence on the web and a website is just one of them. Other types of 
        web presence include social media channels and sites that allow customers to review your business. 
        Before you start making a website, make sure you understand what’s provided by the different types of 
        web presence and the costs and benefits associated with each type.</p>

       <h3>Quality guidelines</h3>
       <p>These quality guidelines cover the most common forms of deceptive or manipulative behaviour, but 
        Google may respond negatively to other misleading practices not listed here. It's not safe to assume 
        that just because a specific deceptive technique isn't included on this page, Google approves of it. 
        Webmasters who spend their energies upholding the spirit of the basic principles will provide a much 
        better user experience and subsequently enjoy better ranking than those who spend their time looking 
        for loopholes they can exploit.</p>
       <h3>Champions League Quarter Finals</h3>
       <p>A strange enough start, though. Mitroglou prances down the Benficaright and fires a low cross into the 
        Bayern box. It’s a decent delivery, but there’s nobody there to take a shot on goal. Bayern clear, and 
        Ribery dances down the left again. He feeds Douglas Costa down the channel. Douglas Costa stands 
        one up to the far post, and Vidal heads home into the right-hand portion of the net with the greatest of 
        ease from six yards!</p>
       <ul>
           <li>Barcelona</li>
           <li>Manchester United</li>
           <li>Real Madrid</li>
           <li>Paris ST. Germain</li>
           <li>Wolfsburg</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Open Bridge from Photoshop</h3>
       <p>To open Bridge from within Photoshop, go up to the File menu (in Photoshop) in the Menu Bar along 
        the top of the screen and choose Browse in Bridge. If you're the type who likes keyboard shortcuts, you 
        can choose the same command by pressing Ctrl+Alt+O (Win) or Command+Option+O (Mac)</p>
       <ol>
           <li>Go to the file menu</li>
           <li>From the drop down select Browse in Bridge</li>

       </ol>
       <h3>Bathtubs</h3>
       <p>American Standard Sonoma White Rectangular Skirted Bathtub with Left-Hand Drain
        Also commonly known as Jacuzzi bathtubs, after the most well-known manufacturer of this type of tub, 
        whirlpool tubs use jets driven by a pump to agitate the water, or an air system to create bubbles; some 
        use a combination of the two. Many people find them extremely relaxing. If you have frequent muscle 
        or joint pain, or just enjoy the luxury of a spa, you may want to consider a whirlpool tub. Whirlpool tubs 
        are available in a wide range of sizes and types, from very small to soaker-size; freestanding to walk-in.</p>
